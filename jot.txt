You are given a document of information and possibly an occurrence. You will extract the following data from this document: the EVENT that occurred, the DATE or WHEN that event occurred, the LOCATION of that occurrence, and any ENTITY that participated in the event. Please structure this nicely. We plan to organize this data as a knowledge graph. "Event" OCCURRED_ON "Date", "Event" OCCURRED_AT "Location", "Entity" PARTICIPATES_IN "EVENT". And the input "Document" MENTIONS "Entity" and "Document" MENTIONS "Event".
